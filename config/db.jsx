import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';

const pg = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);//neon() initializes a connection to your database using a connection string.The pg variable now contains a client object that you can use to make queries using the Neon HTTP interface.




 const db = drizzle({ client: pg });//client: pg passes the Neon HTTP client we just created to Drizzle ORM so it knows how to connect and send queries.Itâ€™s your toolkit to access and manipulate your database, with methods like:db.select(), db.insert(), db.update(), and db.delete().




 export default db;
